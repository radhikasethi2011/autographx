Shahin, 
Broooo, I will never ever forget how we would stand in the bus-stop for hours in the scorching sun and think, "Yaar, itti si Shahin itna bada book leke kyu ghumti hai...😂😂😂😂😂"
I appreciate how you would call me up jab mera naam aata tha shortlist mai.
All those K B Joshi ke bahar vaali gossip sessions.
All the best bro.Stay in Touch❤️

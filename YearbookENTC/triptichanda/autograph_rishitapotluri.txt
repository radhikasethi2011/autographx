Tripti,
Every damn time that i think of you, I think, "shit, we souldn't have drifted apart."
Even though we did, I love how we could talk so easily out of no where.You have marked my attendance God knows how many times😂😂😂. You are a true Genius Tripti. The first picture I took in college was of us. 
Stay in touch?
All the best❤️
